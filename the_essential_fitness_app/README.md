## DESCRIPTION
Looking for a fitness app that motivates you to work out without the hassle of
costly subscriptions? The Essential Fitness App is designed to keep you inspired and
engaged. This app helps you track your workouts while adding a fun, gamified experience. It
records your bottom, average, and top running speeds during each session using location
data, monitors your progress on lifts, and generates performance scores based on your
data. To encourage healthy competition, the app features a verified running leaderboard.
Additionally, it provides detailed progression charts for all exercises, helping you visualize
your progress and stay motivated. All this information will be stored securely in a database
using Firestore.
